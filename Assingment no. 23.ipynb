    "Adjusting the scale or range: You can modify the scale or range of the axes to ensure that all figures are adequately displayed. This can be done by setting appropriate limits for the x-axis and y-axis. By adjusting the scale, you can zoom in or out to emphasize the differences between the figures.\n",

    "Adding legends or labels: Including a legend or labels on the graph can provide clear identification of each figure. Legends can describe the meaning of each figure, while labels can provide additional context or details. This aids in understanding and comparing the different figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing multiple plot types: Instead of using a single plot type, you can incorporate multiple plot types on the same graph. For example, you can use a line plot for one figure and a scatter plot for another. This allows for different visual representations and facilitates comparison."

    "# Q2. Can you explain the benefit of compound interest over a higher rate of interest that does not\n",

    "# Ans=\n",
    "Compound interest offers several advantages over a higher rate of interest that does not compound. Here are the key benefits of compound interest:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exponential growth: Compound interest allows your money to grow exponentially over time. With compound interest, the interest you earn is added back to the principal amount, and subsequent interest calculations are based on the updated total. As a result, your investment has the potential to grow at an accelerated rate, especially over long periods. In contrast, a higher rate of interest that does not compound would result in linear growth, which is comparatively slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased returns over time: The compounding effect means that your investment accumulates interest not only on the initial principal but also on the accumulated interest. This compounding cycle generates a snowball effect, leading to higher returns over time. As the investment duration increases, the compounding effect becomes more pronounced, allowing your wealth to grow significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhanced long-term financial goals: Compound interest is particularly advantageous for achieving long-term financial goals, such as retirement planning or saving for education expenses. By starting early and allowing your investments to compound over a longer period, you can harness the power of compounding to accumulate substantial wealth. Even with a lower interest rate but consistent compounding, the ultimate growth can surpass a higher rate of interest that does not compound.\n",
    "\n",
    "Passive income generation: Compound interest can generate passive income streams. As your investment grows, the interest earned can be reinvested or withdrawn, providing a source of income without requiring active effort. This passive income can supplement your regular income and contribute to financial stability and freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Capitalization of reinvested earnings: With compound interest, reinvested earnings or dividends are also subject to compounding. If you invest the earned interest or dividends back into the same investment vehicle, they contribute to the compounding process, further accelerating the growth of your wealth."

    "Yes, string data can be stored in numpy arrays. However, there is a restriction known as the \"fixed-size\" restriction that applies to string data in numpy arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fixed-size restriction means that when storing string data in a numpy array, each element of the array must have the same fixed size. This fixed size is determined by the maximum length of the strings in the array. Numpy arrays allocate a fixed amount of memory for each element, and all elements must occupy the same amount of memory. Consequently, if you want to store strings of varying lengths in a numpy array, you must determine the maximum length and allocate enough space to accommodate the longest string. This can lead to inefficient memory usage if most of the strings in the array are shorter than the maximum length.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you define a numpy array to store strings with a maximum length of 10 characters, all strings stored in that array must have a length of 10 characters, even if some strings are shorter. If a string exceeds the specified length, it will be truncated to fit within the allocated space.\n",

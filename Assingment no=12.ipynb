    "In Python, there are two common ways to index a character within a string:\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive indexing: This is the most common way to index a character in a string. It starts from 0 and goes up to the length of the string minus 1. Each character can be accessed by specifying its index within square brackets [].\n",

    "\n",
    "In Python, indexing and slicing are related concepts used to access portions of a sequence, such as strings, lists, or tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing refers to the process of accessing a single element or character at a specific position within the sequence. It involves specifying the index of the desired element within square brackets [].\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing, on the other hand, refers to extracting a contiguous portion or a subsequence of elements from the original sequence. It involves specifying a range of indices within square brackets [], separated by a colon :.\n",

    "The relationship between indexing and slicing can be understood as follows:\n",

    "Returns a single element at the specified index.\n",
    "Uses a single index value within square brackets [].\n",

    "Slicing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns a subsequence of elements within the specified range of indices.\n",
    "Uses a start index, an end index (exclusive), and an optional step size, separated by colons [:].\n",

    "# Q8. What is the benefit of first checking the target string with in or not in before using the index\n",

    "Ans=\n",
    "Checking the target string with the in or not in operators before using the index method to find a substring can provide a benefit in terms of avoiding potential errors or exceptions. Here are the main advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding errors: When using the index method directly to find a substring, it raises a ValueError if the substring is not found in the target string. By first checking with in or not in, you can prevent this error and handle the situation gracefully.\n",

    "index = s.index(\"Goodbye\")  # Raises ValueError: substring not found\n",

    "    index = s.index(\"Goodbye\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    index = -1  # Substring not found\n",
    "By performing the in or not in check, you can decide how to handle the case when the substring is not present in the target string, rather than encountering an unexpected error.\n",

    "Performance: float numbers are implemented using the native floating-point representation in hardware, which is typically more efficient in terms of memory usage and computational speed.\n",
    "Wide Range: float numbers can represent a wide range of values, including very large and very small numbers, due to their dynamic range.\n",

    "Precision Issues: Floating-point numbers have limited precision. They cannot represent all decimal numbers exactly and can introduce small rounding errors in calculations, especially during arithmetic operations.\n",

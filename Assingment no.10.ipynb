    "__getattr__(self, name): This method is called when an attribute is accessed and not found through normal means. It is a fallback method that is only invoked if the attribute does not exist as a regular instance attribute or through inheritance. The name parameter represents the name of the attribute being accessed. It allows you to dynamically handle attribute access and provide a custom response or behavior when an attribute is not found. If __getattr__ is not defined or it raises an AttributeError itself, a regular AttributeError will be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "__getattribute__(self, name): This method is called for every attribute access, regardless of whether the attribute exists or not. It is invoked before checking if the attribute exists as a regular instance attribute or through inheritance. This method is often used to intercept attribute access and customize behavior for all attribute accesses. However, you need to be cautious because calling other attribute accesses within __getattribute__ can lead to infinite recursion. To access instance attributes within __getattribute__, it's common to use the base class's __getattribute__ method directly.\n",

It allows you to dynamically provide values for attributes that are not present.\n",

It takes the name of the attribute being accessed as an argument. This method allows you to implement custom behavior for all attribute accesses, but you need to be cautious as it can override the normal attribute access and potentially lead to infinite recursion if not implemented carefully."

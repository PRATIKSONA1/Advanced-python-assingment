    "Memory efficiency: Generators produce values on-demand, one at a time, as they are needed. They don't generate the entire sequence of values upfront and store them in memory, unlike lists or other data structures. This characteristic makes generators memory-efficient, especially when dealing with large or infinite sequences, as they only hold the current value in memory.\n",

    "Lazy evaluation: Generators follow the concept of lazy evaluation, meaning they compute and yield values only when requested. This lazy evaluation allows you to work with sequences that would otherwise be impractical to generate or store in memory all at once. It enables you to process large datasets or infinite sequences efficiently, as you can generate and consume values progressively, on-the-fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterative and pipeline processing: Generators can be easily integrated into iterative processes and pipeline operations. By chaining multiple generators together, you can create efficient data processing pipelines, where each generator performs a specific transformation or filtering operation on the input data. This approach avoids unnecessary intermediate data structures and allows for efficient and modular processing of data."
